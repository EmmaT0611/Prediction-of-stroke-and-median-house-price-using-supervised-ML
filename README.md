#PROJECT SUMMARY

Machine learning(ML) model trained as part of mini project for the 3 months Data Science & AI bootcamp at Institute of Data (Singapore).
There are 2 ML model trained using supervised learning.   

Objective:

1. Predicting median house price using ML regression algorithm
2. Predicting the occurrence of stroke using ML classification algorithms

#STEPS TO REPRODUCE CODE

Refer requirement.txt for libraries and environment setup needed
Datasets, codes and models (pickle file) in respective case studies folder; predict median house price_ml & predict stroke_ml
